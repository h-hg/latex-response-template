\section{How to use}

\subsection{Basic usage}

In general, this template provides several environment to identify different reviewers and editors.
A simple example is as follows.

\begin{minted}[]{latex}
\begin{Editor}[Associate Editor]
  \begin{CommentSummary}
    A summary/general comment of associate editor.
  \end{CommentSummary}
  \begin{Response}
    Your response.
  \end{Response}
\end{Editor}
\begin{Reviewer}
  \begin{CommentSummary}
    A summary/general comment of reviewer.
  \end{CommentSummary}
  \begin{Response}
    Your response.
  \end{Response}
  \begin{ReviewerComment}
    A comment of the reviewer.
  \end{ReviewerComment}
  \begin{Response}
    Your response.
  \end{Response}
\end{Reviewer}
\end{minted}

Reviewers are automatically numbered using Arabic numerals by default.
You can also give the number to the reviewer like follow. 
Note that this behavior will change the number of subsequent reviewers.
\begin{minted}[]{latex}
\begin{Reviewer}
  % reviewer 1
\end{Reviewer}
\begin{Reviewer}[3]
  % reviewer 3
\end{Reviewer}
\begin{Reviewer}
  % reviewer 4
\end{Reviewer}
\end{minted}
Comments of reviewer are numbered using Roman numerals automatically.
More details, please see the .tex and .sty files.

\subsection{Display of content}

An introduction to topological sorting will be used to introduce the arrangement of content, such as figures, algorithms and reference.

Topological sort is an algorithm for sorting a directed acyclic graph (DAG).
It arranges all the vertices $v$ in the graph $G$ into a linear sequence $L$, making the starting vertex of any edge in $G$ is arranged before its ending vertex in $L$.
From the perspective of discrete mathematics, the vertices of an edge can be regarded as a partial order, and then topological sorting can be defined as obtaining a total order of the set from the set of partial orders.
The most typical implementation of topological sorting is the Kahn algorithm~\cite{kahn1962topological}, which continuously removes the vertex with zero indegree in the graph $G$ and append the vertex into the end of the current sequence $L$.
Its pseudo code is shown in \autoref{algo:kaha}, and \autoref{fig:kaha-example} is an example of this pseudo code.


\begin{algorithm}[H]

\end{algorithm}


\begin{figure}[H]

  \subfloat[Subfigure 3\label{fig:kaha-example-c}]{

  \caption{
    A example of Kaha algorithm.
    In \autoref{fig:kaha-example-a}, indegree of $v_0$ and $v_1$ is zero, thus, they are pushed into the $Q$.
    In \autoref{fig:kaha-example-b}, $v_0$ is popped out, the edge starting from it is removed, and then put $v_0$ into $L$.
    In \autoref{fig:kaha-example-c}, $v_1$ is popped out and put into $L$, the edge $e_{12}$ is removed, $v_2$ is pushed into $Q$.
    In \autoref{fig:kaha-example-d}, $v_2$ is popped out and put into $L$, edges $e_{23}$ and $e_{24}$ are removed, $v_4$ is pushed into $Q$.
    In \autoref{fig:kaha-example-e}, $v_4$ is popped out and pushed into $L$, edge $e_{43}$ is removed, $v_3$ is pushed into $Q$.
    In \autoref{fig:kaha-example-f}, $v_3$ is popped out and push into $L$.

\Tip In order to distinguish the  \mintinline{latex}{\ref} or  \mintinline{latex}{\autoref} in the response letter from the paper, a alphabet R. will be used as a prefix in the letter.

\subsection{Draft Mode}

There is a draft mode is this template.
The content in environment `Draft' will only be displayed when the draft mode is turned on.

\begin{minted}[]{latex}

\begin{Draft}
  This section will only be displayed if you set `IfDraft` to `True` in the `letter.tex`.
  You can set `IfDraft` to `False` after finishing the letter.
\end{Draft}

\end{minted}

\subsection{Label}

The Label command can be used to display the label.
It can be used with draft mode like follow.

\begin{minted}[]{latex}
\begin{Response}
  Your response here.
  \begin{Draft}
    \begin{flushright}
      \textbf{Assigment:} Someone who needs to reply to it\\
      \Hard \\
    \end{flushright}
  \end{Draft}
\end{Response}
\end{minted}

The effect is shown in the frame below

\begin{framed}
\noindent \textbf{Response}~\\

Your response here.

\begin{flushright}
  \textbf{Assigment:} Someone who needs to reply to it\\
  \Hard \\
\end{flushright}
\end{framed}

The built-in labels are list as follows.
\begin{itemize}
  \item \Hard
  \item \Medium
  \item \Easy
  \item \Done
  \item \Tip
\end{itemize}

You can customize your labels by \mintinline{latex}{\Label{color}{text}}.
