    Thank you very much for pointing out this issue.
    We have carefully formatted all the references in the revised manuscript.
    The above three reference formats are presented as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[\texttt{[8]}\enspace] \fullcite{kahn1962topological}

      \item[\texttt{[38]}] \fullcite{he2016deep}
    \end{enumerate}
